# Neural Network Components

* Tensor - The key data structure which flows through the network
* Nodes - Individual units, connected using weights and grouped within layers
* Weights - Weighted connections between nodes
* Bias term - An offset parameter which is added to the weighted sum of the inputs
* Gradients - Represent the partial derivatives of the loss function with respect weights and biases
* Loss Function - Measures the neural networkâ€™s predictions against the target values
* Activation Function - Applied to the output of each node, introduces non-linearity into the network
* Regularisation - Used to prevent overfitting by adding a penalty to the loss function
* Optimisation - Used to update the model parameters based on the computed gradients
