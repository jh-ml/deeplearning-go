# Deep Learning with Go

Welcome to this introduction to Deep Learning. This guide has been written primarily for software engineers who would like an overview of this fascinating field of computation. It covers the core components of neural networks and how they function.

The [deeplearning-go](https://github.com/jh-ml/deeplearning-go) framework has been designed with a modular structure in mind, allowing for the creation of dynamic neural network architectures and experimentation. It's a work in progress while venturing deeper into the field. Please submit a pull request if you'd like to contribute. ðŸ™‚
