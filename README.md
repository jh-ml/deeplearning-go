## deeplearning-go

The framework has been designed with a modular structure in mind, allowing for the creation of dynamic neural network architectures and experimentation. It's a work in progress while venturing deeper into the field. Please submit a pull request if you'd like to contribute. ðŸ™‚

[There is an accompanying guide written on gitbook](https://deeplearning-go.gitbook.io/deeplearning-go/), primarily for software engineers who would like an overview of this fascinating field of computation. It covers the core components of neural networks and how they function.
